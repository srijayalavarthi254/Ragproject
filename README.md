##Ragproject
##Overview
Ragproject is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to provide enhanced text generation and search capabilities. The project integrates external knowledge bases to generate contextual responses, leveraging tools like OpenAI's GPT models, vector embeddings, and cosine similarity for text similarity evaluation.

###Key Features
Retrieval-augmented text generation for improved contextuality.
Efficient vector search using deeplake for text embeddings.
Cosine similarity evaluation to measure response relevance.
Supports pre-trained transformer models for embeddings using sentence-transformers.
Flexible integration with external knowledge bases.
##Installation
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

##Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
A valid OpenAI API key
Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries by running the following commands:

##bash

pip install openai
pip install deeplake
pip install sentence-transformers
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
pip install textwrap3  # Optional, for text formatting
pip install markdown   # Optional, for rendering markdown responses
pip install nltk
pip install spacy
Additionally, download the language model for SpaCy:

##bash

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Usage
Clone the Repository

##bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Ragproject.git
cd Ragproject
Add API Keys

Save your OpenAI API key in a file named api_key.txt.
Save your Activeloop token in a file named activeloop.txt.
Place these files in the root directory of the project:
Ragproject/
├── api_key.txt
├── activeloop.txt
Run the Project Use the following command to execute the main script:

##bash

python main.py
Additional Examples You can execute other modules like augmented_generation.py, datacollections.py, or embeddings_vector.py for specific tasks:

#bash

python augmented_generation.py
python datacollections.py
python embeddings_vector.py

#How It Works
Data Retrieval:

Input queries are embedded using sentence-transformers or OpenAI's embedding models.
Similar vectors are retrieved using deeplake.
Augmented Generation:

The retrieved data is combined with the user query to enhance context.
GPT (OpenAI models like text-davinci-003 or gpt-4) generates a detailed response.

##Evaluation:

Responses are evaluated using cosine similarity to ensure relevance to the query.
