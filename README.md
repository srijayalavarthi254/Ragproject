##Ragproject

##Overview

Ragproject is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to provide enhanced text generation and search capabilities. The project integrates external knowledge bases to generate contextual responses, leveraging tools like OpenAI's GPT models, vector embeddings, and cosine similarity for text similarity evaluation.

###Key Features

Retrieval-augmented text generation for improved contextuality.

Efficient vector search using deeplake for text embeddings.

Cosine similarity evaluation to measure response relevance.

Supports pre-trained transformer models for embeddings using sentence-transformers.

Flexible integration with external knowledge bases.

#How It Works

Data Retrieval:

Input queries are embedded using sentence-transformers or OpenAI's embedding models.

Similar vectors are retrieved using deeplake.

Augmented Generation:

The retrieved data is combined with the user query to enhance context.

GPT (OpenAI models like text-davinci-003 or gpt-4) generates a detailed response.

##Features
#Document Retrieval: Collects and processes documents from URLs.

#Vector Store: Uses Deep Lake for storing document embeddings.

#Indexing: Generates and queries document indexes for efficient retrieval.

#Search Engine: Executes queries on documents using various indexing strategies (Vector Store, Tree, List, Keyword).

#Performance Metrics: Measures execution time and query performance.

##Query Engine
Various query engines are available to search the documents based on user input. The following engines are implemented:

#Vector Store Index: Uses cosine similarity for document retrieval.

#Tree Index: Organizes documents hierarchically for efficient search.

#List Index: Indexes documents in a list format for retrieval.

#Keyword Index: Queries based on keywords for document matching.

##Evaluation:

Responses are evaluated using cosine similarity to ensure relevance to the query.

#Performance Evaluation

The project provides performance evaluation by calculating:

Average Query Execution Time

Cosine Similarity Score

Performance Metric (based on query speed and relevance)

##Conclusion

This RAG framework integrates state-of-the-art document retrieval and generation techniques, providing a flexible and efficient approach to process and query large document datasets.
